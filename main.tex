%%  Finally, here is the meat.  The idea is to compose a 
%%  .tex file for each section of your thesis or dissertation.  
%%  Then use LaTeX's \include command to put them all together.  
%%  Doing it this way makes it easier to change the order of 
%%  exposition as your writing is in progress.  Also it
%%  makes it easy to print out just one section. The \include
%%  command always starts a new page. So every section would 
%%  start on a new page.  If you would like for sections just
%%  to continue, after the appropriate vertical space, on the
%%  current page, then use the \input command instead of the 
%%  \include command.
