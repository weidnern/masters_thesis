\section{SuperView}\label{sec:superview}
The GoPro cameras starting with Hero 3+ are employing a video capture mode termed {\em SuperView}. According to GoPro, SuperView works by dynamically stretching the 4:3 aspect ratio of the original image into a 16:9 aspect ratio. This keeps the center of the frame unchanged, but severely distorts the edges. The outcome is an image that captures more of the standard 1080p resolution mode. The exact image transform GoPro uses to fit the new aspect ratio is undisclosed so removing the distortion in post processing is not an option. As can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:comparisons}, there is a drastic difference in images collected in GoPro's SuperView mode and their scene vertically and adjusts the aspect ratio to fit a standard wide screen. Many standard video editing software packages such as Adobe Premier, Adobe After Effects, or GoPro's own GoPro Studio have undistortion features, but these apply a stylistic look which does not help to calibrate the camera properly.
