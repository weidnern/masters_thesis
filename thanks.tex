This work could not have been completed without the tremendous support of my family, friends, and colleagues. My advisor Ioannis Rekleitis has been an amazing support, and I am grateful for his funding along the way. This work has been all together funded by a Magellan scholarship from the University of South Carolina, the National Science Foundation (NSF 1513203, 1637876), and a Google Faculty Research Award. I am indebted to the cave divers:  John Rose, Steve Cox, Mark Garland, and Blake Wilson for collecting the cave video data used for experimentation and producing the results. I am also thankful from the help and support of the other members of my Committee: Marco Valtorta, Jason O'Kane, and Song Wang, as well as various members of the Autonomous Field Robotics Lab including Sharmin Rahman, Alberto Quattrini Li, Marios Xanthidis, Nare Karapetyan, Md Modasshir, and Shannon Hood.
