  Abstract                 = {We propose a direct (feature-less) monocular SLAM algorithm which, in contrast to current state-of-the-art regarding direct methods, allows to build large-scale, consistent maps of the environment. Along with highly accurate pose estimation based on direct image alignment, the 3D environment is reconstructed in real-time as pose-graph of keyframes with associated semi-dense depth maps. These are obtained by filtering over a large number of pixelwise small-baseline stereo comparisons. The explicitly scale-drift aware formulation allows the approach to operate on challenging sequences including large variations in scene scale. Major enablers are two key novelties: (1) a novel direct tracking method which operates on sim(3), thereby explicitly detecting scale-drift, and (2) an elegant probabilistic solution to include the effect of noisy depth values into tracking. The resulting direct monocular SLAM system runs in real-time on a CPU.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a method of estimating camera pose in an unknown scene. While this has previously been attempted by adapting SLAM algorithms developed for robotic exploration, we propose a system specifically designed to track a hand-held camera in a small AR workspace. We propose to split tracking and mapping into two separate tasks, processed in parallel threads on a dual-core computer: one thread deals with the task of robustly tracking erratic hand-held motion, while the other produces a 3D map of point features from previously observed video frames. This allows the use of computationally expensive batch optimisation techniques not usually associated with real-time operation: The result is a system that produces detailed maps with thousands of landmarks which can be tracked at frame-rate, with an accuracy and robustness rivalling that of state-of-the-art model-based systems.},

Our main contribution is a comprehensive methodology for sampling-based design of inspection routes, including an algorithm for planning, an algorithm for smoothing, and an analysis of probabilistic completeness. The latter two outcomes are the first of their kind in the area of coverage planning. Our algorithms give high-quality solutions over expansive structures, and we demonstrate this with experiments in the laboratory and on a 75 m Coast Guard cutter.},

abstract = {This field note details the operations and discusses the results of an experiment conducted in the unstructured environment of an underwater cave complex, using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that was modified for simultaneous horizontal and vertical mapping using acoustic sonars. For this experiment the caves spatial complexity required AUV guidance by a diver. This field deployment successfully demonstrates a scan matching algorithm in a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework that significantly reduces and bounds the localization error for fully autonomous navigation. These methods are generalizable for AUV exploration in confined underwater environments where surfacing or pre-deployment of localization equipment are not feasible and may provide a useful step toward AUV utilization as a response tool in confined underwater disaster areas.},

		We present an algorithm that computes a minimal-cost pursuer trajectory for
		a single pursuer to solve the visibility-based pursuit-evasion problem in a
		simply-connected two-dimensional environment. This algorithm improves upon
		the known algorithm of Guibas, Latombe, LaValle, Lin, and Motwani, which is
		complete but not optimal.  Our algorithm uses a Tour of Segments (ToS)
		subroutine to construct a pursuer path that minimizes the distance traveled
		by the pursuer while guaranteeing that all evaders in the environment will
		be captured.  We have implemented our algorithm in simulation and provide
		results.

	abstract = { This paper proposes an approach to calibrate off-the-shelf cameras and inertial sensors to have a useful integrated system to be used in static and dynamic situations. When both sensors are integrated in a system their relative pose needs to be determined. The rotation between the camera and the inertial sensor can be estimated, concurrently with camera calibration, by having both sensors observe the vertical direction in several poses. The camera relies on a vertical chequered planar target and the inertial sensor on gravity to obtain a vertical reference. Depending on the setup and system motion, the translation between the two sensors can also be important. Using a simple passive turntable and static images, the translation can be estimated. The system needs to be placed in several poses and adjusted to turn about the inertial sensor centre, so that the lever arm to the camera can be determined. Simulation and real data results are presented to show the validity and simple requirements of the proposed methods. }

@article{2011_Kelly_Visual, abstract = {Visual and inertial sensors, in combination, are able to provide accurate motion estimates and are well suited for use in many robot navigation tasks. However, correct data fusion, and hence overall performance, depends on careful calibration of the rigid body transform between the sensors. Obtaining this calibration information is typically difficult and time-consuming, and normally requires additional equipment. In this paper we describe an algorithm, based on the unscented Kalman filter, for self-calibration of the transform between a camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Our formulation rests on a differential geometric analysis of the observability of the camera--IMU system; this analysis shows that the sensor-to-sensor transform, the IMU gyroscope and accelerometer biases, the local gravity vector, and the metric scene structure can be recovered from camera and IMU measurements alone. While calibrating the transform we simultaneously localize the IMU and build a map of the surroundings, all without additional hardware or prior knowledge about the environment in which a robot is operating. We present results from simulation studies and from experiments with a monocular camera and a low-cost IMU, which demonstrate accurate estimation of both the calibration parameters and the local scene structure.}, author = {Jonathan Kelly and Gaurav S.
